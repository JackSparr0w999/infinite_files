# infinite_files
Simple programs that create infinite files
The code actually creates 1000 files, but you can create as many
files as you want by adding a few things on the code (I written how to do that)
I'm trying to create a program that creates infinite files.
The only problem is that if I add characters on the name of the file,
sooner or later, the name of the file will be way too long to be saved.
So the only method that could works is to change the file name itself after creating some.
